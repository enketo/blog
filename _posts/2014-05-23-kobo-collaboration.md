Enketo LLC is proud to be collaborating with the rockstar [KoboToolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) team at [Harvard Humanitarian Iniative](http://hhi.harvard.edu/) to create a brand new Enketo app!

[![KoboToolbox logo](../files/2014/05/kobotoolbox_logo.jpg "KoboToolbox logo")](http://www.kobotoolbox.org)

The purpose of this app is to give users of the [new KoboToolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/updates/2013/11/new-kobotoolbox-will-target-humanitarian-disasters) (to be released this summer) easy access to Enketo webforms, such as building and previewing forms entirely offline. It is being built from the ground up around the existing [Enketo Core](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core) library using cutting-edge tools. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-express).

More news will be announced when we approach the launch date of the new toolbox! Keep your eye on this blog and on the [KoboToolbox website](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/).
