### Improvements

This is a snapshot of the main improvements to Enketo in the past 6 months:

* Added basic [Range widget](http://xlsform.org/en/#range). 
* Added Ranking widget.
* Added URL widget.
* Added [`randomize()` function](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/#randomize) that can be used for choice options (select, rank). This function is exposed [via a shortcut in XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/en/#randomize-choices) for easy use.
* Added [`decimal-time()` function](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/#decimal-time).
* Added [`distance()` function](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/#distance).
* Performance of autocomplete widget with huge external data files (XML or CSV) has improved enormously in Chrome and Firefox (15,000 items is not a problem on most devices!).
* The expression `". < today()"` should now work as expected across time zones (a 5 year old bug).
* The required asterisks (*) now update in real-time if an expression is used.
* All draw widgets now have a download function (like the file upload widgets).
* Drawing and annotate widgets now have an _undo_ button.
* File upload widgets now support "new", "new-front", "new-rear" on some cutting-edge mobile browsers.
* Reset functionality for draw and file upload widgets now requires confirmation.
* New line and paragraph handling in labels and hints has improved.
* Many styling and accessibility improvements.
* API endpoints for PDF-creation of empty forms and records were added. 
* Loading performance has been improved. 
* Russian and Polish translations were added.
* Installation has been simplified and the [instructions](https://blog.enketo.org/install-enketo-production-ubuntu/) were updated. It is recommended to install a new Ubuntu 18.04 server and migrate the configuration and database file to ensure easy future updates.

All this work was sponsored by [OpenClinica](https://www.openclinica.com/), [KoboToolbox](http://kobotoolbox.org), and by the [Survey123 team at Esri](https://survey123.arcgis.com/). 

### Specifications

The documentation work under the DIAL "dirty jobs" Catalytic Grant on the [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org) and [XForm](https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/) specifications has been completed. Many thanks to DIAL for this great boost to the ODK ecosystem!

### Future

A proposal was submitted for a DIAL Strategic Grant. The proposed project entails turning the Enketo Project into a multi-stakeholder-managed project. The proposal was developed by a partnership between [Enketo LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/enketo-llc/), [Medic](https://medic.org/), [OpenClinica](https://www.openclinica.com/), and [KoboToolbox](http://kobotoolbox.org), with consultation by the ODK leadership.
