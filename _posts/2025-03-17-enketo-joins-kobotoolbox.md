We're excited to share that the **KoboToolbox team has officially taken over the maintenance and development of Enketo**.

Enketo started in 2009 as a web-based alternative to ODK Collect, and over the years it has become a key part of various data collection platforms including [ODK](https://getodk.org/) and, of course, [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org). Every day, hundreds of thousands are collecting data through Enketo web forms in KoboToolbox, and we look forward to investing more to make this indispensable tool even better by directly taking responsibility of its future.

At KoboToolbox, we’ve relied on Enketo for many years to provide our users with a flexible, browser-based form-filling experience that works both online and offline. We invested a lot in the early days of the platform as an independent platform for webform-based data collection together with its original creator, Martijn van de Rijdt. This included creating Enketo Express to allow fully offline data collection, adding many advanced features that users demanded from the availability on the Collect Android app, and open-sourcing all components of Enketo for wider distribution. Now, we’re proud to be taking on this great project’s future development and ensuring its continued availability as a vital open-source tool for humanitarian, development, and research work worldwide.

We’re deeply grateful for the incredible work that Martijn has done over the past decade in creating and leading Enketo, and for the stewardship of the ODK team in recent years that has made the Enketo codebase better, faster, and easier to maintain. We look forward to building on this foundation—continuing to improve performance, security, and compatibility, while also exploring new opportunities to extend Enketo’s capabilities to meet the evolving needs. This will include native audio recording, easier theming, improved user experience for complex form navigation, and much more.

We welcome suggestions, contributions, and collaboration proposals! Please post your suggestions on the KoboToolbox [community forum](https://community.kobotoolbox.org/), we look forward to building this next chapter with all the loyal Enketo users around the world.

Many thanks again to everyone who has contributed to Enketo over the years — you’ve made this an indispensable tool for so many.
