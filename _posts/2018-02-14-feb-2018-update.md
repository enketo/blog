Though there isn't anything quite as sexy to announce as the [Image Map](./image-map/) or [Draw/Signature](./drawing) widgets, a lot has improved in Enketo in the last half a year! 

### Improvements

Here is a snapshot of the recent improvements in Enketo:

* Full support for the annotate widget. Try it out in the [widgets](https://enke.to/::widgets) form.
* Date and time handling has much improved.
* File pickers now have a download option - particulary useful for editing or viewing draft records or submitted records.
* File pickers now show the maximum acceptable file size before uploading.
* Many more messages are translatable. You can help translate them [here](https://www.transifex.com/enketo/enketo-express/dashboard/).
* Printing has much improved, especially for complicated widgets.
* Groups and repeats are now collapsible.
* Styling of radiobuttons and checkboxes is now consistent in Firefox and Internet Explorer 11.
* Modal dialogs are now consistent - previously there were 2 very different types.
* Hundreds of bugs were fixed.
* Architecture of Enketo Core library has improved to make it easier to integrate Enketo's form engine into a custom app.

All this work was sponsored by [OpenClinica](https://www.openclinica.com/), [KoBoToolbox](http://kobotoolbox.org), [Ona](https://ona.io), and by the [Survey123 team at Esri](https://survey123.arcgis.com/). 

### XForms and XLSForms documentation

I'm also pleased to announce that the [DIAL Impact Alliance](https://digitalimpactalliance.org/) has provided a 'dirty jobs' grant to Enketo to help clear the backlog in [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/) and [XForms](https://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/) documentation. This documentation is very important for the health of the [Open Data Kit](https://opendatakit.org/)(ODK) ecosystem that Enketo is a proud member of. 

Thanks to DIAL and special thanks to 2 of ODK's many amazing contributors: [Yaw Anokwa](https://forum.opendatakit.org/u/yanokwa/summary) and [Hélène Martin](https://forum.opendatakit.org/u/ln/summary), for putting together a succesful grant proposal.
